MAPS-store key-value pairs
SET-store only keys

HashMap stores data in the form of key value pairs while the HAshSet stores only objects. Map uses a put method, and Set uses an add method. Hashmap is also faster because unique keys are used to access objects. 

Hashmap is an implementation of Map interface. It is an array, and inside each entry in the array is a linked list. 
Treemap implements NavigableMap interface. It is an array list and always keeps the elements in order all the time. Uses red-black trees. 

Java's version of heap is PriorityQueue.
